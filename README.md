=========================

This repository contains the code from the blog post [How Many Threads Does It Take to Fill a Pool?](http://wix.io/2013/06/12/how-many-threads-does-it-take-to-fill-a-pool/)

We investigate the overhead of different Jdbc connection pools, in terms of connection checkout and release times.
